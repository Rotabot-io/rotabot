## Development

Rotabot uses [testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) to ensure that the tests have everything they need to run. Make sure you have docker running locally.

In order to run the tests you need to do the following:

```shell
make install # You only need to do this once

make test
```

If you want to run the app locally you can do so by running `make dev`. This will start a PG database for you.

Once you have the app running you can connect to slack's API by using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
